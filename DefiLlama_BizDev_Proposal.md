# Proposal: Business Development Role at DefiLlama

Hello DefiLlama Team,

My name is **Deni Dudaev**, and I am a blockchain and fintech entrepreneur with nearly a decade of experience building ventures, forging strategic partnerships, and scaling growth across Europe, Latin America, and the Middle East.

I have been in crypto since late 2016. Previously, I served as **Head of EMEA Business Development at SwissBorg**, where I contributed to its record-breaking **CHF 52M ICO in 2018**. Since then, I have co-founded and invested in multiple blockchain startups, secured **government contracts for blockchain adoption in Latin America**, and built global partnerships with institutions, regulators, and brands.

As a DefiLlama user, I’ve witnessed firsthand how you’ve become the most trusted aggregator in DeFi. I see an opportunity to help expand your **reach, partnerships, and revenue** by establishing a dedicated **Business Development function**.
