# LGTM
I'm a Sr SWE engineer, i've built countless things, mostly crypto some not, famously KlimaDAO, worked at RNDR, built IoT systems. Worked on a ton of different things as a contractor. 
But the best projects I ever worked on and most successful were ones I had full ownership over. They turned out the best because I got to care about my work and the code behind it. 

TLDR: Please merge, ill build anything and everything.
