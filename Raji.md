Application to DefiLlama - Frontend Developer 

Hi DefiLlama Team,
I'm applying to join DefiLlama as a Frontend Developer

Past Experience:

Decenter AI: Worked on decentralized AI infrastructure for model training, gaining experience with decentralized systems, blockchain integration, and distributed computing platforms


Onchain & Maritime Tech Solutions: Built solutions bridging traditional industries with blockchain technology, giving me insight into real-world protocol integration and data tracking

Why DefiLlama:
Your emphasis on open-source transparency, neutral data provision, and high-autonomy culture resonates deeply with me. Having worked in decentralized infrastructure at Decenter AI, I understand the importance of self-sovereign systems and transparent data. I thrive in environments where I can drive product decisions independently and ship fast - your no-meetings, async culture is exactly how I work best.

DefiLlama's mission to provide free, open-source, and neutral DeFi analytics aligns with my belief that decentralized ecosystems need unbiased infrastructure to succeed.


Looking forward to contributing!
